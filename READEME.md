Your ReadMe **must** contain:

1. **Title:** A working title for your app. (Feel free to have some fun with this.)
2. **Description:** 4 to 5 sentences summarizing the features, functions, and goals.
3. **Wireframes:** Mockups of your app on desktop, tablet, and mobile.
4. **API:** Which API you will be using. 
5. **MVP:** Write out what your goals are for MVP, including the minimum, need-to-have features of your app.
6. **Post-MVP:** Write out what your goals are for post-MVP, including nice-to-have features that you would like to implement once your MVP is complete.

> For putting wireframes in your ReadMe, we recommend uploading to Imgur, then linking the file directly into your markdown using the `!(imageAlt)[imageURL]` format. The imageURL must be a direct link ending with the file format, such as `.png`.
