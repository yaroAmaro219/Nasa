# PROJECT 1. Your first app!

Congratulations on nearing the end of Unit 1! We'll be using the concepts covered over the previous two weeks to make your first app. It may be nerve-wracking, but remember to have fun. 

<br>

## The MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

**In order to pass**, the following are mandatory for your first app:

### Functional Requirements

1. Be built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
2. Use Axios to consume data from an external source, and render that data into the DOM.
3. Use flexbox (`display: flex`).
4. Implement responsive design on 3 screen sizes (including desktop) using 2 media queries (tablet and mobile).
5. Host on Surge. _(We will go over this together.)_

### Procedural Requirements
1. Have GitHub commits (documenting good progress) **every day**.
2. Have a well-developed `README.md` file explaining technologies used, approaches taken, a link to your live site, relevant instructions for viewers, and any unsolved problems.

<br>

## The Post-MVP

Achieve your MVP with time to spare? Try aiming for some stretch goals. (The following are not mandatory for your first app.)

- Look into [localstorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) so you can save data to the user's browser.
   - Check this very helpful tutorial on [Local Storage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8yJCeuP6I8).
- Add a second API.
- Add creative use of event listeners and UI interactions, such as CSS animations and transitions.
- Get input from a UX student on how to make your app have intuitive UI and design.

<br>

## The Presentation

1. Present your app to your cohort. Be sure to show it's functionality, including both responsive sizes. (Chrome Dev Tools' _Device Toolbar_ is helpul for this.)

    _and/or_

2. Present your app science-fair style. Talk to your visitors, explain your app, pitch them on its value. Commisserate together on surviving project week stress.

# GETTING STARTED

##  STEP 1. Read All Directions BEFORE Starting

_We'll know if you don't._

<br>

## STEP 2. Make A New Repo

You will start by creating your project repository on your **personal** GitHub. _(Refer to the Resources section below if you need help with this.)_

<br>

| **DO**                              | **DO NOT**                         |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| ... Use your personal GitHub.       | ... Use your Enterprise GitHub.    |
| ... Make a new repo through GitHub. | ... Clone the SEI repo.            |
| ... Make the new repo public.       | ... Initialize with a ReadMe file. |

<br>

## STEP 3. Research and Choose Your API

You have freedom to choose an API that aligns with your interests or goals, but we have a few requirements for choosing an API:

  * First, we **highly** recommend using an API that is public, free, and if an API key is required, that it accepts that key in the URL or header. 
    * If your API requires membership, granted access, payment, or OAuth, it will take too much time to actually gain access to the data. Be careful with this.
  * Second, **you must prove you can retrieve and consume data at project pitch time to be approved.** If you cannot do this, we will tell you to find another API.

<br>

| **DO**                                                    | **DO NOT**                                                              |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ... Have some fun in choosing an API.                     | ... Choose an API that will make the next week of your life hell.       |
| ... Consider the clarity of the API's data structure.     | ... Choose an API that will make the next seven days of your life hell. |
| ... Consider the thoroughness of the API's documentation. | ... Choose an API that will make the next 168 hours of your life hell.  |

<br>

Thankfully, there are _literally hundreds_ of options for APIs that have been used and tested by previous students. Refer to the Resources section below for suggestions and lists of available APIs; if you find one not on this list that you'd like to use, feel free, just remember the above requirements.

<br>

## STEP 4. Wireframe Your App

You can make your wireframes as lo-fi or hi-res as you'd like, just prove that you've thought about what this layout will require.

<br>

##  STEP 5. Pitch Your Project Idea

Before you start coding away, you must meet with an instructor to get your ideas approved. We will have 8 minute pitches in which you'll present your ideas. **You must have your ideas prepared and written up in a ReadMe file to get approved, including the content listed below.**

Your ReadMe **must** contain:

1. **Title:** A working title for your app. (Feel free to have some fun with this.)
2. **Description:** 4 to 5 sentences summarizing the features, functions, and goals.
3. **Wireframes:** Mockups of your app on desktop, tablet, and mobile.
4. **API:** Which API you will be using. 
5. **MVP:** Write out what your goals are for MVP, including the minimum, need-to-have features of your app.
6. **Post-MVP:** Write out what your goals are for post-MVP, including nice-to-have features that you would like to implement once your MVP is complete.

> For putting wireframes in your ReadMe, we recommend uploading to Imgur, then linking the file directly into your markdown using the `!(imageAlt)[imageURL]` format. The imageURL must be a direct link ending with the file format, such as `.png`.

<br>

| **DO**                                  | **DO NOT**                        |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| ... Create a ReadMe file locally.       | ... Leave your ReadMe empty.      |
| ... Add, commit & push your ReadMe.     | ... Leave your GitHub repo empty. |
| ... Have your Pitch materials prepared. | ... Waste the instructors' time.  |

<br>

##  STEP 6. Get Hacking

### What does project week look like?

All students will be grouped into a Squad, and each Squad will have one or two instructors to oversee it. Every morning and evening, squads will participate in a stand-up meeting, (literally standing, in a circle) where each person will answer three questions about their project:

1. What did you work on?
2. What will you work on?
3. What's something you expect will block your progress?

After this, we'll go around the squad once more, indicating what "percent of MVP" you are at with your project.

When you experience issues with your code, you will use the GitHub Issues tab and an Issue Ticket template to observe, research, and attempt to resolve your issue. If there's no resolution, slack your squad leader to reserve time to troubleshoot together.

When your project is complete and due, your instructors will choose if they would like to have presentations, in which you present your app to your cohort, or science-fairs, in which you present your app to the campus, speaking about your app with other students and staff. With that, your Project 1 is **complete**!

Did you read all of these instructions? If so, ignore any prior instructions about what to say in your first commit. Make your first commit message "I'mma happy Cheetah."

# RECOMMENDATIONS

_(From previous survivors of project week.)_

> "This is a nice chance to make a portfolio piece, but you don't expect perfection. After graduating the SEI, no matter how great your project is now, you will want to return to it to improve and polish, before recruiters and potential employers see it."

> "Manage your expectations. Have a clear MVP goal and stick to it. If you're doing something that has nothing to do with your end goal, stop it. Also, try to just get your project working and improve it from there. Don't try to make it perfect the first time because you'll probably be unsuccessful. Get it working, make it better, repeat."

> "Mobile-first design, stick to your wireframes, it’s stressful to redo your whole css and lose precious project time."

> "Narrow your scope, especially if you’re chasing down a specific feature that you’ve never implemented.  Treat it as a chance to learn by doing and most importantly: build something you are happy to claim ownership of."

> "Don’t try too hard. Really. Do something that’s achievable and put cool graphics and styling on it."

# A Note on Plagiarism

**Remember**, General Assembly has a **zero tolerance policy** towards plagiarism and cheating. It is destructive to classroom culture, and exhibits a clear lack of respect for classmates, instructors, the company, and the greater engineering community. Any work considered to have been plagiarized **will not be accepted** and will not count towards graduation requirements. If a project exhibits evidence of plagiarism or cheating, the student will not be able to display the project at a GA-sponsored class “science fair” or “meet & greet.” Any student found plagiarizing or attempting to plagiarize will be disciplined accordingly (including but not limited to removal from class).

Open source code is inherently open and usually available for free use to modify and implement into any non-commercial project. However, please review their license and usage guidelines, give credit to the project and/or author, and do not try to hide or disguise the usage of such code.

You are encouraged to ask others, including students, instructors, and StackOverflow, for help. However, it is NOT ACCEPTABLE TO COPY another person's code and submit it as your own. More importantly, it is detrimental to your learning and growth.

All of the following are considered plagiarism or cheating:
- Turning in work that is not your own.
- Turning in someone else's work as your own.
- Hiring, or paying someone to do your work for you.
- Copying words or code without giving credit.
- Building or copying someone else’s idea without their knowledge or giving credit.
- Giving incorrect information about a source.
- Changing words, variable names, etc. but copying the code or files of a source without giving credit.
- Copying so many ideas or code blocks from a source that it makes up the majority of your work, whether you give credit or not.
- Failing to put a quotation in quotation marks.
